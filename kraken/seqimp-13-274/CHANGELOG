12-109:
170412: Altered paired-end length distribution plot axis to clearly delineate read lengths
170412: Added read counts and percentages of processed reads to Bowtie mapping bar graph for small RNA analysis
180412: Added processed read counts to small RNA filter plots
180412: Added lane title to all QC plots
180412: Resized Bowtie plot axes

12-110:
190412: Reformatted manual
190412: Incorporate maximum base quality for tally FASTQ output for paired end sequencing

12-118:
200412: Allow specification of --no-unique which will not stop the pipeline from appending the process ID to the analysis directory name
270412: Fixed bug in filtering that caused pipeline to crash while checking processed read totals
270412: Fixed bug in presenting total accepted in filter stage of small RNA analysis

12-354:
060912: runmefirst.sh '--system-check' option corrected
061212: Added repeat name to the title of repeat analysis plots
061212: Clarify thread reporting to standard output and error in imp_commandline.pl print statements.
071212: Tweaked alignment QC plots to be more intuitive.

13-002:
020113: Updated default_config files for compatibility with the latest Annotation versions.

13-008:
080113: Edited reaper configuration file for 5' sequence insert for new Reaper parameters.

13-009:
090113: Edited reaper configuration file for paired end, no barcode parameters to remove default head to tail trimming in this case where adapters aren't expected.

13-028:
230113: Corrected typos.
280113: Manual updates.

13-095:
310113: Continued work on improving feedback provided by the pipeline.
210213: Improved documentation.
210213: More typos.
040413: Change headers to miRNA expression table - to be more intuitive.
040413: Introduced large changes to the way that miRNA counts are handled. These include:
            The option to consider each miRNA locus individually as well as merge them based on miRNA ID.
            The option to distribute multi-mapping reads between miRNA loci by a method that considers the distribution
               of uniquely mapping reads. This method no longer considers alignments not associated with miRNA annotation.
            Different methods to handle overlapping miRNA annotations from miRBase.
040413: Update to all Default Configuration files to reflect the new options available for handling miRNA expression matrices.
050413: Further improved documentation to explain new methods for handling miRNA expression counts in more detail.
050413: Added references to manual and --system-check option.

13-274:
250713: Added checks to return helpful error messages.
090913: Identified a problem with an R package inconsistently parsing command line flags between versions.
        Altered pipeline to ensure consistent behaviour with all R versions.
130913: Pipeline quits with non-zero exit code when threads fail.
